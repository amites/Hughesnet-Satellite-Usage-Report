Console based bandwidth usage reporting for Hughesnet Satellite Service.

Found when sharing a satellite with others with lapotops iespecially running Windows *shudder* we would often have unexpected spikes in bandwidth and run close to the cap to be put into the "Fair Access Policy" zone.

Upon sharing this little tool I find it much easier to know when it's safe to download that video, or push an update to a remote server witout threatening internet access.

2 ways to use it:
 - Run from console - enter Site Id when prompted.
 - Set your Site Id on line 9 to a string value such as 'SITEID', example given in source.

Requires installation of BeautifulSoup - tested using version 3.2.0

Please contact me if you have any trouble using this script.
There is great room for improvement, if there is enough feedback I will likely package it as a django app and run it on google apps.
